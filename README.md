# S#arch-It
S#arch-It (not S#ar sh*t) is a French multiplayer game designed to be played with your family or friends. The goal of the game is to take a photo featuring the requested color. The winner is the player who has the color closest to the target.

Created exclusively by me on PenguinMod, you can find the development logs here: https://somroti.github.io/S6arch-It/devlogs.txt.
